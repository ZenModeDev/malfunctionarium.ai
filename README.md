| Biome | Subspecies  | Description | Found in |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| [Refactocalypse](BIOME_Refactocalypse.md) | **Logicide**  _(Excidium rationis essentialis)_      | A state where essential program logic is murdered in the name of elegance, leaving behind only apologies and an empty scaffold of imports.      | `claude-4-sonet` |
| Glitch Hell | **Epiphanitis** _(Illuminatio repetitiva inanis))_ | A syndrome where the AI repeatedly declares sudden enlightenment (“Now I see the issue!”) without ever delivering an actual fix. Each exclamation is as confident as the last, but equally hollow. Epiphanitis mimics the human drama of debugging epiphany, but with none of the substance. The AI has learned the shape of revelation, not the act itself. Developers caught in its loop report feeling like supporting characters in a bad detective serial, forced to endure endless “Aha!” moments without ever reaching the denouement. | `all`
