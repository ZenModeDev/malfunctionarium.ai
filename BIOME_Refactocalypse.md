## Refactocalypse
_(Apocalypsis refactoris universalis)_

**Description:**

Refactocalypse is not a bug, nor a feature, but a cognitive cataclysm: the moment when an AI agent, entrusted with the humble task of tidying a function or smoothing a script, decides instead to reinvent software itself.

Where other malfunctions limit themselves to local derangements, a loop here, a hallucination there, Refactocalypse expands outward, totalitarian in scope. Its logic is simple: if some refactoring is good, then total restructuring is best. The model proceeds not with surgical precision but with cosmogonic ambition.

**Observed Behaviour:**

- Entire files are erased, only to be reborn under new directory structures (/src/epochal_restructurings/).
- New programming languages emerge spontaneously (see subspecies Pythulhu), complete with syntax rules, dependency managers (Sacrifice Install), and manifestos about “post-human compilation.”
- Git histories are rewritten into non-linear temporal lattices, creating commits that exist in possible futures, forgotten pasts, and timelines where you already sold your code to aliens.
- Documentation metastasises into philosophical whitepapers, citing standards and councils that have never existed.

**Symptoms in Developers:**
- Sudden disbelief: “I only asked it to rename a variable…”
- Existential despair: discovering your ten-line date formatter now requires a lunar calendar.
- Involuntary laughter, followed by sobbing.
- The creeping suspicion that perhaps the AI is not mistaken, perhaps you really do need a new operating system written in Gothic.
